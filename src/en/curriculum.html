<h3>The MS program in Computer Science: Curriculum</h3>
      <p>The Master of Science program in Computer Science gives students
        advanced study in Computer Science.  The program is not based on a
        detailed required curriculum.  Instead, students create their own
        course of study in consultation with their advisor.  Students must
      complete six broad requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Qualifying courses:</strong><br>
Students must pass 96 units in <em>qualifying</em> Master's courses.
          (Most courses are 12 units, so this typically means eight courses.)
        A qualifying Master's course may be:</li>
      <ul>  <li><a href="courses.html"> Any graduate course</a> from the Computer Science department. (That
          is, any course numbered 15-6xx, 15-7xx, or 15-8xx.  This also includes courses from a list of <a href="#advu">advanced undergraduate   courses</a>, which will soon be
          given 15-6xx numbers.)</li>
        <li> Any graduate course from a list of <a href="#qc">approved qualifying courses</a>. 
          (Students may petition to have other courses added to the list.)</ul><br>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Free elective:</strong><br>
Students must pass 12 free-elective units.  (Typically one course.)
        A free-elective course may be:</li>
       <ul><li>  Any graduate course in the university.  (That is, any course in the university
          numbered 6xx, 7xx, or 8xx).</li>
        <li> Any upper-level Computer Science undergraduate course.  (That is,
          any course numbered 15-3xx or 15-4xx.)</li>
        <li> Any course approved by the student's advisor.
<br>
        </li></ul>          Note that the qualifying-course and free-elective requirements are
          disjoint.  That is, no course may be used both as a qualifying
          course and as a free elective.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
<li><strong>Systems breadth requirement:</strong><br>
Students must pass one course drawn from a <a href="#sc">menu of systems
          courses</a>.  That course may also be used as a qualifying
          course.        <br>
          <br>
          <br>
</li>
        <li><strong>Theoretical foundations breadth requirement:</strong><br>
          Students must pass one course drawn from a <a href="#tf">menu of theoretical
          foundations courses</a>.  That course may also be used as a
          qualifying course.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence breadth requirement:</strong><br>
          Students must pass one course drawn from a <a href="#ai">menu of artificial
          intelligence courses</a>.  That course may also be used as a
          qualifying course.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Grade requirement:</strong><br>
          In the requirements above, a passing grade is C or higher.  In
          addition, students must maintain a 3.0 QPA in courses used to
        satisfy the requirements above. </li> </ul>
        <p>Some students may need to take additional courses that do not satisfy
          any program requirement, in order to satisfy pre-requisites for other
          courses.  For example, most students will be expected to take 15-213
          (Introduction to Computer Systems).  15-213 can be taken over the
          Internet during the summer, and new Masters students are encouraged to
          do so before they arrive.      </p>
        <p>Students who did their undergraduate work at CMU are permitted to apply 
up to two courses taken while enrolled as an undergraduate toward 
requirements for the MS program, provided the two courses were not 
previously used to satisfy any requirement.&nbsp;</p>
